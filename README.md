#File-Sharing-App-Backend

I made this file sharing app, its backend code, frontend code will be adding soon.

To get started, download or clone the project, To Clone, simply paste the URL : <em>git clone https://github.com/sujitmeshram/File-Sharing-App-Backend.git
  
1. Go to .env file (make sure to rename '.env.example' as '.env', and add all the necessary credentials. 
2. for SMTP, I used sendinblue.com's service
  so simply go on <a href="sendinblue.com">sendinblue.com </a> and register yourself, after that head over to "SMTP & API" and put all the credentials in the .env file
  
3. go to terminal and type <em> npm install</em>
4. to run :<em> npm run dev</em>
